most web apps, i.e. accounts/login, API and (somewhat) interactive UI.

Try it out by installing the dependencies using
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

    uv sync

Migrate:

    uv run python manage.py migrate

And then start the server (default: http://localhost:8000)

    uv run python manage.py runserver

Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the
[landing page](http://localhost:8000/)
